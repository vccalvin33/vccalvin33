### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a fifth semester student concentrating in actuarial mathematics. My current interest is playing and exploring data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, especially in the field of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.  I have also been working in projects as UI/UX Designer and Researcher.
