## Hi thereðŸ‘‹

Having loved math for as long as I can remember, I have a deep passion for exploring data through AI to solve real-world challenges. I believe in lifelong learningâ€”every experience offers a lesson, and I'm always eager to discover something new.

I enjoy meaningful conversations and exchanging thoughts on technology, finance, and, honestly, just about anything in life. If youâ€™d like to connect, feel free to reach outâ€”letâ€™s grab a coffee and chat! â˜•
